We&#8217;re just going to wind up back here anyway. When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power\u2026like God must feel when he&#8217;s holding a gun.

Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive? I don&#8217;t like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there&#8217;s too many fat children. I&#8217;ve done everything the Bible says \u2014 even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff!
