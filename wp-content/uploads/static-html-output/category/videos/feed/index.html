										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. Kids, kids. I&#8217;m not going to die. That only happens to bad people. Kids, kids. I&#8217;m not going to die. That only happens to bad people. Slow down, Bart! My legs don&#8217;t know how to be as long as yours.<br />
</p>
<h2>The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show</h2>
<p>D&#8217;oh. What&#8217;s the point of going out? We&#8217;re just going to wind up back here anyway. When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power…like God must feel when he&#8217;s holding a gun. Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three &#8220;Highlander&#8221; movies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you&#8217;d step over your own mother just to get one! But you can&#8217;t stop at one. You wanna drink another woman!</li>
<li>When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power…like God must feel when he&#8217;s holding a gun.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Natural Born Kissers</h3>
<p>They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day. Save me, Jeebus. I didn&#8217;t get rich by signing checks.</p>
<h4>The Last Temptation of Homer</h4>
<p>I can&#8217;t go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. What good is money if it can&#8217;t inspire terror in your fellow man? Jesus must be spinning in his grave! Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I&#8217;m kidding, I&#8217;m kidding. I work, I work. And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold.</p>
<ol>
<li>Jesus must be spinning in his grave!</li>
<li>We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.</li>
<li>I was saying &#8220;Boo-urns.&#8221;</li>
<li>I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Marge vs. Monorail</h5>
<p>Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs. Human contact: the final frontier. Oh, so they have Internet on computers now!</p>
<h6>Homer the Great</h6>
<p>How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive? I don&#8217;t like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there&#8217;s too many fat children. I&#8217;ve done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! Homer no function beer well without. Me fail English? That&#8217;s unpossible.</p>

<h2>The Force Unleashed</h2>
<p>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. What good is a reward if you ain&#8217;t around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain&#8217;t my idea of courage. It&#8217;s more like…suicide. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I call it luck. Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. Partially, but it also obeys your commands.</p>
<ul>
<li>I can&#8217;t get involved! I&#8217;ve got work to do! It&#8217;s not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it right now. It&#8217;s such a long way from here.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t believe in the Force, do you?</li>
<li>Ye-ha!</li>
<li>You mean it controls your actions?</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Sith Lords</h3>
<p>What?! Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. What!?</p>
<h4>A New Hope</h4>
<p>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Red Five standing by. Alderaan? I&#8217;m not going to Alderaan. I&#8217;ve got to go home. It&#8217;s late, I&#8217;m in for it as it is. Ye-ha! I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I&#8217;m getting too old for this sort of thing.</p>
<ol>
<li>Look, I ain&#8217;t in this for your revolution, and I&#8217;m not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I&#8217;m in it for the money.</li>
<li>Your eyes can deceive you. Don&#8217;t trust them.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</li>
</ol>
<h5>The Empire Strikes Back</h5>
<p>You mean it controls your actions? You don&#8217;t believe in the Force, do you? The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>
<h6>The Sith Lords</h6>
<p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I&#8217;m getting too old for this sort of thing. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn&#8217;t I break his legs? Tell them I hate them. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn&#8217;t rock.</p>
<h2>The Honking</h2>
<p>Hey, guess what you&#8217;re accessories to. I love this planet! I&#8217;ve got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. Actually, that&#8217;s still true. Good man. Nixon&#8217;s pro-war and pro-family. Meh. Yeah, lots of people did.</p>
<ul>
<li>Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!</li>
<li>Bender, this is Fry&#8217;s decision… and he made it wrong. So it&#8217;s time for us to interfere in his life.</li>
<li>WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!</li>
<li>Hello Morbo, how&#8217;s the family?</li>
</ul>
<h3>A Big Piece of Garbage</h3>
<p>Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Man, I&#8217;m sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Well I&#8217;da done better, but it&#8217;s plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.</p>
<h4>The Why of Fry</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m sure those windmills will keep them cool. I was all of history&#8217;s great robot actors &#8211; Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! I saw you with those two &#8220;ladies of the evening&#8221; at Elzars. Explain that. I don&#8217;t &#8216;need&#8217; to drink. I can quit anytime I want!</p>
<ol>
<li>THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</li>
<li>I can explain. It&#8217;s very valuable.</li>
<li>Eeeee! Now say &#8220;nuclear wessels&#8221;!</li>
<li>Oh God, what have I done?</li>
</ol>
<h5>Parasites Lost</h5>
<p>You wouldn&#8217;t. Ask anyway! You wouldn&#8217;t. Ask anyway! I suppose I could part with &#8216;one&#8217; and still be feared…</p>
<h6>Anthology of Interest II</h6>
<p>With gusto. Our love isn&#8217;t any different from yours, except it&#8217;s hotter, because I&#8217;m involved. Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I&#8217;m going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. &hellip;And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night. That&#8217;s why I love elementary school, Edna. The children believe anything you tell them.</p>
<h2>Natural Born Kissers</h2>
<p>A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow&hellip;and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?* Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It&#8217;s what separates us from the animals&hellip;except the weasel. Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There&#8217;s a *New* Mexico?</p>
<ul>
<li>The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity&hellip;</li>
<li>Duffman can&#8217;t breathe! OH NO!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Life on the Fast Lane</h3>
<p>Uh, no, they&#8217;re saying &#8220;Boo-urns, Boo-urns.&#8221; I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. Duffman can&#8217;t breathe! OH NO! Inflammable means flammable? What a country.</p>
<h4>Selma&#8217;s Choice</h4>
<p>&#8220;Thank the Lord&#8221;? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don&#8217;t have a place within an organized religion. I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. I hope this has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn. Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that&#8217;s even remotely true!</p>
<ol>
<li>I didn&#8217;t get rich by signing checks.</li>
<li>Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I&#8217;m kidding, I&#8217;m kidding. I work, I work.</li>
<li>Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Rosebud</h5>
<p>Jesus must be spinning in his grave! Hi. I&#8217;m Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as &#8220;Smoke Yourself Thin&#8221; and &#8220;Get Some Confidence, Stupid!&#8221; Last night&#8217;s &#8220;Itchy and Scratchy Show&#8221; was, without a doubt, the worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world. Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me! We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.</p>
<h6>Cape Feare</h6>
<p>Old people don&#8217;t need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use. Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone. Hi. I&#8217;m Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as &#8220;Smoke Yourself Thin&#8221; and &#8220;Get Some Confidence, Stupid!&#8221; Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it. Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. This is the greatest case of false advertising I&#8217;ve seen since I sued the movie &#8220;The Never Ending Story.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fry! Stay back! He&#8217;s too powerful! I&#8217;ve been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? I love you, buddy!</p>
<h2>The Deep South</h2>
<p>Good man. Nixon&#8217;s pro-war and pro-family. Say it in Russian! You lived before you met me?! Ooh, name it after me! Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Why would a robot need to drink?</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There&#8217;s only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!</li>
<li>You, a bobsleder!? That I&#8217;d like to see!</li>
<li>Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.</li>
</ul>
<h3>I Second That Emotion</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? It must be wonderful. You&#8217;re going to do his laundry? In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan!</p>
<h4>Put Your Head on my Shoulder</h4>
<p>You know, I was God once. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.</p>
<ol>
<li>THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</li>
<li>Calculon is gonna kill us and it&#8217;s all everybody else&#8217;s fault!</li>
<li>Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.</li>
<li>I love you, buddy!</li>
</ol>
<h5>Anthology of Interest I</h5>
<p>Bender, hurry! This fuel&#8217;s expensive! Also, we&#8217;re dying! Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Stop it, stop it. It&#8217;s fine. I will &#8216;destroy&#8217; you!</p>
<h6>Anthology of Interest I</h6>
<p>Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. I never loved you. Take me to your leader! Hey, whatcha watching?</p>
