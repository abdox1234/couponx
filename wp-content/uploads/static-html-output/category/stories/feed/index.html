										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s only one man I&#8217;ve ever called a coward, and that&#8217;s Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I&#8217;m calling you is a television actor. Army had half a day. That&#8217;s why you always leave a note!</p>
<h2>Exit Strategy</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn&#8217;t date magicians. Say goodbye to these, because it&#8217;s the last time!</p>
<ul>
<li>Marry me.</li>
<li>Oh, you&#8217;re gonna be in a coma, all right.</li>
<li>I care deeply for nature.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Amigos</h3>
<p>No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. I&#8217;ve opened a door here that I regret. I care deeply for nature.</p>
<h4>Pier Pressure</h4>
<p>Oh, you&#8217;re gonna be in a coma, all right. I don&#8217;t understand the question, and I won&#8217;t respond to it. Not tricks, Michael, illusions. Across from where? Well, what do you expect, mother? No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer&#8217;s questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.</p>
<ol>
<li>That&#8217;s what it said on &#8216;Ask Jeeves.&#8217;</li>
<li>Well, what do you expect, mother?</li>
<li>Marry me.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s called &#8216;taking advantage.&#8217; It&#8217;s what gets you ahead in life.</li>
<li>Steve Holt!</li>
</ol>
<h5>Ready, Aim, Marry Me</h5>
<p>What&#8217;s Spanish for &#8220;I know you speak English?&#8221; That&#8217;s what it said on &#8216;Ask Jeeves.&#8217; Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. No… but I&#8217;d like to be asked! Really? Did nothing cancel? But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn&#8217;t that mean anything anymore?</p>
<h6>Afternoon delight</h6>
<p>We just call it a sausage. I&#8217;ve opened a door here that I regret. Marry me. No… but I&#8217;d like to be asked!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What?! The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. I&#8217;m trying not to, kid.</p>
<h2>Jedi Academy</h2>
<p>Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. What!? As you wish. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you&#8217;re going.</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan&#8211;</li>
<li>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m trying not to, kid.</li>
<li>He is here.</li>
<li>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Empire Strikes Back</h3>
<p>As you wish. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. He is here.</p>
<h4>Jedi Academy</h4>
<p>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Don&#8217;t underestimate the Force. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There&#8217;s nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. What good is a reward if you ain&#8217;t around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain&#8217;t my idea of courage. It&#8217;s more like…suicide.</p>
<ol>
<li>Dantooine. They&#8217;re on Dantooine.</li>
<li>What good is a reward if you ain&#8217;t around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain&#8217;t my idea of courage. It&#8217;s more like…suicide.</li>
<li>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</li>
</ol>
<h5>The Phantom Menace</h5>
<p>I can&#8217;t get involved! I&#8217;ve got work to do! It&#8217;s not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it right now. It&#8217;s such a long way from here. Don&#8217;t underestimate the Force. Don&#8217;t underestimate the Force.</p>
<h6>Attack of the Clones</h6>
<p>Still, she&#8217;s got a lot of spirit. I don&#8217;t know, what do you think? Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. As you wish. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keep your mind limber. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. This man is a knight in shining armor. Keep your mind limber. You all right, Dexter?</p>
<h2>Born Free</h2>
<p>Watching ice melt. This is fun. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I&#8217;m real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. He taught me a code. To survive.</p>
<ul>
<li>I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me.</li>
<li>Finding a needle in a haystack isn&#8217;t hard when every straw is computerized.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Take It!</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m going to tell you something that I&#8217;ve never told anyone before. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. Like a sloth. I can do that. Cops, another community I&#8217;m not part of. I&#8217;m really more an apartment person.</p>
<h4>Father Knows Best</h4>
<p>You all right, Dexter? You all right, Dexter? He taught me a code. To survive. I&#8217;m really more an apartment person.</p>
<ol>
<li>Cops, another community I&#8217;m not part of.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m doing mental jumping jacks.</li>
<li>I think he&#8217;s got a crush on you, Dex!</li>
<li>I&#8217;m really more an apartment person.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Popping Cherry</h5>
<p>I think he&#8217;s got a crush on you, Dex! Cops, another community I&#8217;m not part of. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. He taught me a code. To survive. I think he&#8217;s got a crush on you, Dex! Watching ice melt. This is fun.</p>
<h6>An Inconvenient Lie</h6>
<p>I&#8217;m generally confused most of the time. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. I&#8217;m really more an apartment person. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.</p>

<p>Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn&#8217;t like his trailer. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. Marry me. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough.</p>
<h4>Pier Pressure</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve opened a door here that I regret. We just call it a sausage. I care deeply for nature. Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you&#8217;ll have more fun. What&#8217;s Spanish for &#8220;I know you speak English?&#8221;</p>

<p>Whoa, this guy&#8217;s straight? There&#8217;s so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. He&#8217;ll want to use your yacht, and I don&#8217;t want this thing smelling like fish. Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you&#8217;ll have more fun.</p>

<p>&hellip;Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? On second thoughts, let&#8217;s not go there. It is a silly place. Burn her anyway!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>But with the blast shield down, I can&#8217;t even see! How am I supposed to fight? Don&#8217;t be too proud of this technological terror you&#8217;ve constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There&#8217;s nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
<h2>The Rebel Force</h2>
<p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I&#8217;m getting too old for this sort of thing. I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan&#8211; I want to come with you to Alderaan. There&#8217;s nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Ye-ha! The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</p>
<ul>
<li>I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</li>
<li>Your eyes can deceive you. Don&#8217;t trust them.</li>
<li>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Return of the Jedi</h3>
<p>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. Red Five standing by. Ye-ha! I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</p>
<h4>Imperial Star Destroyer</h4>
<p>I can&#8217;t get involved! I&#8217;ve got work to do! It&#8217;s not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it right now. It&#8217;s such a long way from here. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. You don&#8217;t believe in the Force, do you?</p>
<ol>
<li>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I&#8217;m getting too old for this sort of thing.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</li>
<li>Look, I ain&#8217;t in this for your revolution, and I&#8217;m not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I&#8217;m in it for the money.</li>
</ol>
<h5>The Phantom Menace</h5>
<p>Don&#8217;t be too proud of this technological terror you&#8217;ve constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. What good is a reward if you ain&#8217;t around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain&#8217;t my idea of courage. It&#8217;s more like&hellip;suicide. I call it luck.</p>
<h6>Rebel Mission to Ord Mantell</h6>
<p>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can&#8217;t possibly&hellip; The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan&#8211; I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan&#8211;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m normally not a praying man, but if you&#8217;re up there, please save me, Superman. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It&#8217;s what separates us from the animals&hellip;except the weasel. I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. When will I learn? The answers to life&#8217;s problems aren&#8217;t at the bottom of a bottle, they&#8217;re on TV! Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try.</p>
<h2>Radioactive Man</h2>
<p>Well, he&#8217;s kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace &#8220;accidentally&#8221; with &#8220;repeatedly&#8221; and replace &#8220;dog&#8221; with &#8220;son.&#8221; What&#8217;s the point of going out? We&#8217;re just going to wind up back here anyway. You don&#8217;t win friends with salad. I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. Bart, with $10,000 we&#8217;d be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like&hellip;love!</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix.</li>
<li>Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There&#8217;s a *New* Mexico?</li>
<li>Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rosebud</h3>
<p>Ahoy hoy? I&#8217;ll keep it short and sweet &mdash; Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. Bart, with $10,000 we&#8217;d be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like&hellip;love!</p>
<h4>Cape Feare</h4>
<p>Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix. Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you&#8217;re experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box&hellip; Uh, no, they&#8217;re saying &#8220;Boo-urns, Boo-urns.&#8221; Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark. &#8220;Thank the Lord&#8221;? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don&#8217;t have a place within an organized religion. I didn&#8217;t get rich by signing checks.</p>
<ol>
<li>I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world.</li>
<li>This is the greatest case of false advertising I&#8217;ve seen since I sued the movie &#8220;The Never Ending Story.&#8221;</li>
<li>When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power&hellip;like God must feel when he&#8217;s holding a gun.</li>
</ol>
<h5>The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show</h5>
<p>I hope I didn&#8217;t brain my damage. Jesus must be spinning in his grave! Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you&#8217;re experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box&hellip;</p>
<h6>Duffless</h6>
<p>I prefer a vehicle that doesn&#8217;t hurt Mother Earth. It&#8217;s a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction. I was saying &#8220;Boo-urns.&#8221; Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?*</p>
