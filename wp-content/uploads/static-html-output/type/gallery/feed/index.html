<h3>Vincent and the Doctor</h3>
<p>I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don&#8217;t lie to me! It&#8217;s art! A statement on modern society, &#8216;Oh Ain&#8217;t Modern Society Awful?&#8217;! Annihilate? No. No violence. I won&#8217;t stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?!

<h6>Vincent and the Doctor</h6>
<p>Aw, you&#8217;re all Mr. Grumpy Face today. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.&hellip;hey.&hellip;the good things don&#8217;t always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don&#8217;t necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. Saving the world with meals on wheels. I&#8217;m the Doctor, I&#8217;m worse than everyone&#8217;s aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I&#8217;m introducing myself.</p>
