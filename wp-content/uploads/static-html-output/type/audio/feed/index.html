<h2>The Force Unleashed</h2>
<p>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. What good is a reward if you ain&#8217;t around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain&#8217;t my idea of courage. It&#8217;s more like…suicide. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I call it luck. Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. Partially, but it also obeys your commands.</p>
<ul>
<li>I can&#8217;t get involved! I&#8217;ve got work to do! It&#8217;s not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it right now. It&#8217;s such a long way from here.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t believe in the Force, do you?</li>
<li>Ye-ha!</li>
<li>You mean it controls your actions?</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Sith Lords</h3>
<p>What?! Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. What!?</p>
<h4>A New Hope</h4>
<p>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Red Five standing by. Alderaan? I&#8217;m not going to Alderaan. I&#8217;ve got to go home. It&#8217;s late, I&#8217;m in for it as it is. Ye-ha! I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I&#8217;m getting too old for this sort of thing.</p>
<ol>
<li>Look, I ain&#8217;t in this for your revolution, and I&#8217;m not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I&#8217;m in it for the money.</li>
<li>Your eyes can deceive you. Don&#8217;t trust them.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</li>
</ol>
<h5>The Empire Strikes Back</h5>
<p>You mean it controls your actions? You don&#8217;t believe in the Force, do you? The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>
<h6>The Sith Lords</h6>
<p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I&#8217;m getting too old for this sort of thing. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>
