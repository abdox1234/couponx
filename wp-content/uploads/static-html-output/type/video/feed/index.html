										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. Kids, kids. I&#8217;m not going to die. That only happens to bad people. Kids, kids. I&#8217;m not going to die. That only happens to bad people. Slow down, Bart! My legs don&#8217;t know how to be as long as yours.<br />
</p>
<h2>The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show</h2>
<p>D&#8217;oh. What&#8217;s the point of going out? We&#8217;re just going to wind up back here anyway. When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power…like God must feel when he&#8217;s holding a gun. Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three &#8220;Highlander&#8221; movies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you&#8217;d step over your own mother just to get one! But you can&#8217;t stop at one. You wanna drink another woman!</li>
<li>When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power…like God must feel when he&#8217;s holding a gun.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Natural Born Kissers</h3>
<p>They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day. Save me, Jeebus. I didn&#8217;t get rich by signing checks.</p>
<h4>The Last Temptation of Homer</h4>
<p>I can&#8217;t go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. What good is money if it can&#8217;t inspire terror in your fellow man? Jesus must be spinning in his grave! Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I&#8217;m kidding, I&#8217;m kidding. I work, I work. And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold.</p>
<ol>
<li>Jesus must be spinning in his grave!</li>
<li>We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.</li>
<li>I was saying &#8220;Boo-urns.&#8221;</li>
<li>I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Marge vs. Monorail</h5>
<p>Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs. Human contact: the final frontier. Oh, so they have Internet on computers now!</p>
<h6>Homer the Great</h6>
<p>How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive? I don&#8217;t like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there&#8217;s too many fat children. I&#8217;ve done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! Homer no function beer well without. Me fail English? That&#8217;s unpossible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s only one man I&#8217;ve ever called a coward, and that&#8217;s Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I&#8217;m calling you is a television actor. Army had half a day. That&#8217;s why you always leave a note!</p>
<h2>Exit Strategy</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn&#8217;t date magicians. Say goodbye to these, because it&#8217;s the last time!</p>
<ul>
<li>Marry me.</li>
<li>Oh, you&#8217;re gonna be in a coma, all right.</li>
<li>I care deeply for nature.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Amigos</h3>
<p>No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. I&#8217;ve opened a door here that I regret. I care deeply for nature.</p>
<h4>Pier Pressure</h4>
<p>Oh, you&#8217;re gonna be in a coma, all right. I don&#8217;t understand the question, and I won&#8217;t respond to it. Not tricks, Michael, illusions. Across from where? Well, what do you expect, mother? No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer&#8217;s questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.</p>
<ol>
<li>That&#8217;s what it said on &#8216;Ask Jeeves.&#8217;</li>
<li>Well, what do you expect, mother?</li>
<li>Marry me.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s called &#8216;taking advantage.&#8217; It&#8217;s what gets you ahead in life.</li>
<li>Steve Holt!</li>
</ol>
<h5>Ready, Aim, Marry Me</h5>
<p>What&#8217;s Spanish for &#8220;I know you speak English?&#8221; That&#8217;s what it said on &#8216;Ask Jeeves.&#8217; Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. No… but I&#8217;d like to be asked! Really? Did nothing cancel? But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn&#8217;t that mean anything anymore?</p>
<h6>Afternoon delight</h6>
<p>We just call it a sausage. I&#8217;ve opened a door here that I regret. Marry me. No… but I&#8217;d like to be asked!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keep your mind limber. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. This man is a knight in shining armor. Keep your mind limber. You all right, Dexter?</p>
<h2>Born Free</h2>
<p>Watching ice melt. This is fun. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I&#8217;m real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. He taught me a code. To survive.</p>
<ul>
<li>I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me.</li>
<li>Finding a needle in a haystack isn&#8217;t hard when every straw is computerized.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Take It!</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m going to tell you something that I&#8217;ve never told anyone before. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. Like a sloth. I can do that. Cops, another community I&#8217;m not part of. I&#8217;m really more an apartment person.</p>
<h4>Father Knows Best</h4>
<p>You all right, Dexter? You all right, Dexter? He taught me a code. To survive. I&#8217;m really more an apartment person.</p>
<ol>
<li>Cops, another community I&#8217;m not part of.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m doing mental jumping jacks.</li>
<li>I think he&#8217;s got a crush on you, Dex!</li>
<li>I&#8217;m really more an apartment person.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Popping Cherry</h5>
<p>I think he&#8217;s got a crush on you, Dex! Cops, another community I&#8217;m not part of. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. He taught me a code. To survive. I think he&#8217;s got a crush on you, Dex! Watching ice melt. This is fun.</p>
<h6>An Inconvenient Lie</h6>
<p>I&#8217;m generally confused most of the time. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. I&#8217;m really more an apartment person. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.</p>
