										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s only a model. No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she&#8217;s got a wart. He hasn&#8217;t got shit all over him. Well, Mercia&#8217;s a temperate zone! The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.</p>
<h2>What… is your quest?</h2>
<p>The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! Look, my liege! No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she&#8217;s got a wart. And this isn&#8217;t my nose. This is a false one. I don&#8217;t want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</p>
<ul>
<li>The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!</li>
<li>Shut up! Will you shut up?!</li>
<li>Well, Mercia&#8217;s a temperate zone!</li>
</ul>
<h3>First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin</h3>
<p>Shut up! Will you shut up?! Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Shut up! Will you shut up?! Well, I didn&#8217;t vote for you. It&#8217;s only a model. I have to push the pram a lot.</p>
<h4>Blue. No, yel…</h4>
<p>Where&#8217;d you get the coconuts? And this isn&#8217;t my nose. This is a false one. What a strange person. Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. You don&#8217;t vote for kings.</p>
<ol>
<li>Who&#8217;s that then?</li>
<li>And this isn&#8217;t my nose. This is a false one.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</li>
<li>Be quiet!</li>
<li>We shall say &#8216;Ni&#8217; again to you, if you do not appease us.</li>
</ol>
<h5>First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin</h5>
<p>Well, I didn&#8217;t vote for you. Well, Mercia&#8217;s a temperate zone! Who&#8217;s that then? I&#8217;m not a witch. I don&#8217;t want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</p>
<h6>Help, help, I&#8217;m being repressed!</h6>
<p>The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king. Well, she turned me into a newt. A newt? No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she&#8217;s got a wart. On second thoughts, let&#8217;s not go there. It is a silly place.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What?! The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. I&#8217;m trying not to, kid.</p>
<h2>Jedi Academy</h2>
<p>Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. What!? As you wish. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you&#8217;re going.</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan&#8211;</li>
<li>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m trying not to, kid.</li>
<li>He is here.</li>
<li>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Empire Strikes Back</h3>
<p>As you wish. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. He is here.</p>
<h4>Jedi Academy</h4>
<p>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Don&#8217;t underestimate the Force. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There&#8217;s nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. What good is a reward if you ain&#8217;t around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain&#8217;t my idea of courage. It&#8217;s more like…suicide.</p>
<ol>
<li>Dantooine. They&#8217;re on Dantooine.</li>
<li>What good is a reward if you ain&#8217;t around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain&#8217;t my idea of courage. It&#8217;s more like…suicide.</li>
<li>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</li>
</ol>
<h5>The Phantom Menace</h5>
<p>I can&#8217;t get involved! I&#8217;ve got work to do! It&#8217;s not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it right now. It&#8217;s such a long way from here. Don&#8217;t underestimate the Force. Don&#8217;t underestimate the Force.</p>
<h6>Attack of the Clones</h6>
<p>Still, she&#8217;s got a lot of spirit. I don&#8217;t know, what do you think? Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. As you wish. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.</p>

And if you&#8217;re worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense.</p>
<h2>Afternoon delight</h2>
<p>Steve Holt! Across from where? Really? Did nothing cancel? It&#8217;s a hug, Michael. I&#8217;m hugging you. I&#8217;m a monster. That&#8217;s why you always leave a note!</p>
<ul>
<li>That&#8217;s what it said on &#8216;Ask Jeeves.&#8217;</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t understand the question, and I won&#8217;t respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ready, Aim, Marry Me</h3>
<p>Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn&#8217;t like his trailer. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. Marry me. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough.</p>
<h4>Pier Pressure</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve opened a door here that I regret. We just call it a sausage. I care deeply for nature. Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you&#8217;ll have more fun. What&#8217;s Spanish for &#8220;I know you speak English?&#8221;</p>
<ol>
<li>Marry me.</li>

<li>Across from where?</li>
<li>We just call it a sausage.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Pier Pressure</h5>
<p>Whoa, this guy&#8217;s straight? There&#8217;s so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. He&#8217;ll want to use your yacht, and I don&#8217;t want this thing smelling like fish. Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you&#8217;ll have more fun.</p>
<h6>Good Grief!</h6>
<p>Guy&#8217;s a pro. I don&#8217;t understand the question, and I won&#8217;t respond to it. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. I don&#8217;t understand the question, and I won&#8217;t respond to it. There&#8217;s only one man I&#8217;ve ever called a coward, and that&#8217;s Brian Doyle Murray.

<h2>The Unicorn and the Wasp</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m the Doctor, I&#8217;m worse than everyone&#8217;s aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I&#8217;m introducing myself. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don&#8217;t lie to me!</p>
<ul>
<li>Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!</li>
<li>It&#8217;s a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Forest of the Dead</h3>
<p>The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don&#8217;t always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don&#8217;t necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. I hate yogurt. It&#8217;s just stuff with bits in. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won&#8217;t stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I&#8217;m the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm &#8211; and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn&#8217;t you?</p>
<h4>Midnight</h4>
<p>*Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I&#8217;m a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! You hit me with a cricket bat. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?</p>
