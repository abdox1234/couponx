										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s only one man I&#8217;ve ever called a coward, and that&#8217;s Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I&#8217;m calling you is a television actor. Army had half a day. That&#8217;s why you always leave a note!</p>
<h2>Exit Strategy</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn&#8217;t date magicians. Say goodbye to these, because it&#8217;s the last time!</p>
<ul>
<li>Marry me.</li>
<li>Oh, you&#8217;re gonna be in a coma, all right.</li>
<li>I care deeply for nature.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Amigos</h3>
<p>No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. I&#8217;ve opened a door here that I regret. I care deeply for nature.</p>
<h4>Pier Pressure</h4>
<p>Oh, you&#8217;re gonna be in a coma, all right. I don&#8217;t understand the question, and I won&#8217;t respond to it. Not tricks, Michael, illusions. Across from where? Well, what do you expect, mother? No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer&#8217;s questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.</p>
<ol>
<li>That&#8217;s what it said on &#8216;Ask Jeeves.&#8217;</li>
<li>Well, what do you expect, mother?</li>
<li>Marry me.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s called &#8216;taking advantage.&#8217; It&#8217;s what gets you ahead in life.</li>
<li>Steve Holt!</li>
</ol>
<h5>Ready, Aim, Marry Me</h5>
<p>What&#8217;s Spanish for &#8220;I know you speak English?&#8221; That&#8217;s what it said on &#8216;Ask Jeeves.&#8217; Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. No… but I&#8217;d like to be asked! Really? Did nothing cancel? But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn&#8217;t that mean anything anymore?</p>
<h6>Afternoon delight</h6>
<p>We just call it a sausage. I&#8217;ve opened a door here that I regret. Marry me. No… but I&#8217;d like to be asked!</p>

<h2>The Honking</h2>
<p>Hey, guess what you&#8217;re accessories to. I love this planet! I&#8217;ve got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. Actually, that&#8217;s still true. Good man. Nixon&#8217;s pro-war and pro-family. Meh. Yeah, lots of people did.</p>
<ul>
<li>Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!</li>
<li>Bender, this is Fry&#8217;s decision… and he made it wrong. So it&#8217;s time for us to interfere in his life.</li>
<li>WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!</li>
<li>Hello Morbo, how&#8217;s the family?</li>
</ul>
<h3>A Big Piece of Garbage</h3>
<p>Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Man, I&#8217;m sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Well I&#8217;da done better, but it&#8217;s plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.</p>
<h4>The Why of Fry</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m sure those windmills will keep them cool. I was all of history&#8217;s great robot actors &#8211; Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! I saw you with those two &#8220;ladies of the evening&#8221; at Elzars. Explain that. I don&#8217;t &#8216;need&#8217; to drink. I can quit anytime I want!</p>
<ol>
<li>THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</li>
<li>I can explain. It&#8217;s very valuable.</li>
<li>Eeeee! Now say &#8220;nuclear wessels&#8221;!</li>
<li>Oh God, what have I done?</li>
</ol>
<h5>Parasites Lost</h5>
<p>You wouldn&#8217;t. Ask anyway! You wouldn&#8217;t. Ask anyway! I suppose I could part with &#8216;one&#8217; and still be feared…</p>
<h6>Anthology of Interest II</h6>
<p>With gusto. Our love isn&#8217;t any different from yours, except it&#8217;s hotter, because I&#8217;m involved. Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I&#8217;m going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keep your mind limber. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. This man is a knight in shining armor. Keep your mind limber. You all right, Dexter?</p>
<h2>Born Free</h2>
<p>Watching ice melt. This is fun. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I&#8217;m real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. He taught me a code. To survive.</p>
<ul>
<li>I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me.</li>
<li>Finding a needle in a haystack isn&#8217;t hard when every straw is computerized.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Take It!</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m going to tell you something that I&#8217;ve never told anyone before. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. Like a sloth. I can do that. Cops, another community I&#8217;m not part of. I&#8217;m really more an apartment person.</p>
<h4>Father Knows Best</h4>
<p>You all right, Dexter? You all right, Dexter? He taught me a code. To survive. I&#8217;m really more an apartment person.</p>
<ol>
<li>Cops, another community I&#8217;m not part of.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m doing mental jumping jacks.</li>
<li>I think he&#8217;s got a crush on you, Dex!</li>
<li>I&#8217;m really more an apartment person.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Popping Cherry</h5>
<p>I think he&#8217;s got a crush on you, Dex! Cops, another community I&#8217;m not part of. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. He taught me a code. To survive. I think he&#8217;s got a crush on you, Dex! Watching ice melt. This is fun.</p>
<h6>An Inconvenient Lie</h6>
<p>I&#8217;m generally confused most of the time. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. I&#8217;m really more an apartment person. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OK, this has gotta stop. I&#8217;m going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Hey! I&#8217;m a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Ah, computer dating. It&#8217;s like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase &#8220;upside your head.&#8221; I love this planet! I&#8217;ve got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.</p>
<h2>The Cyber House Rules</h2>
<p>Ummm&hellip;to eBay? Hey, guess what you&#8217;re accessories to. Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.</p>
<ul>
<li>I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m Santa Claus!</li>
<li>Leela, Bender, we&#8217;re going grave robbing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Xmas Story</h3>
<p>With gusto. Ah, the &#8216;Breakfast Club&#8217; soundtrack! I can&#8217;t wait til I&#8217;m old enough to feel ways about stuff! Fetal stemcells, aren&#8217;t those controversial? Bender, this is Fry&#8217;s decision&hellip; and he made it wrong. So it&#8217;s time for us to interfere in his life. And remember, don&#8217;t do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don&#8217;t not do it!</p>
<h4>Attack of the Killer App</h4>
<p>But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!</p>
<ol>
<li>Fry, you can&#8217;t just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.</li>
<li>Meh.</li>
<li>If rubbin&#8217; frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don&#8217;t wanna be right.</li>
</ol>
<h5>In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela</h5>
<p>Ah, computer dating. It&#8217;s like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase &#8220;upside your head.&#8221; Ooh, name it after me! Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!</p>
<h6>Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences</h6>
<p>Bender, being God isn&#8217;t easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Hey, tell me something. You&#8217;ve got all this money. How come you always dress like you&#8217;re doing your laundry? Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! I never loved you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m normally not a praying man, but if you&#8217;re up there, please save me, Superman. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It&#8217;s what separates us from the animals&hellip;except the weasel. I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. When will I learn? The answers to life&#8217;s problems aren&#8217;t at the bottom of a bottle, they&#8217;re on TV! Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try.</p>
<h2>Radioactive Man</h2>
<p>Well, he&#8217;s kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace &#8220;accidentally&#8221; with &#8220;repeatedly&#8221; and replace &#8220;dog&#8221; with &#8220;son.&#8221; What&#8217;s the point of going out? We&#8217;re just going to wind up back here anyway. You don&#8217;t win friends with salad. I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. Bart, with $10,000 we&#8217;d be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like&hellip;love!</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix.</li>
<li>Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There&#8217;s a *New* Mexico?</li>
<li>Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rosebud</h3>
<p>Ahoy hoy? I&#8217;ll keep it short and sweet &mdash; Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. Bart, with $10,000 we&#8217;d be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like&hellip;love!</p>
<h4>Cape Feare</h4>
<p>Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix. Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you&#8217;re experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box&hellip; Uh, no, they&#8217;re saying &#8220;Boo-urns, Boo-urns.&#8221; Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark. &#8220;Thank the Lord&#8221;? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don&#8217;t have a place within an organized religion. I didn&#8217;t get rich by signing checks.</p>
<ol>
<li>I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world.</li>
<li>This is the greatest case of false advertising I&#8217;ve seen since I sued the movie &#8220;The Never Ending Story.&#8221;</li>
<li>When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power&hellip;like God must feel when he&#8217;s holding a gun.</li>
</ol>
<h5>The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show</h5>
<p>I hope I didn&#8217;t brain my damage. Jesus must be spinning in his grave! Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you&#8217;re experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box&hellip;</p>
<h6>Duffless</h6>
<p>I prefer a vehicle that doesn&#8217;t hurt Mother Earth. It&#8217;s a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction. I was saying &#8220;Boo-urns.&#8221; Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?*</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Burn her anyway! Well, we did do the nose. And this isn&#8217;t my nose. This is a false one.</p>
<h2>Am I right?</h2>
<p>I am your king. No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she&#8217;s got a wart. &hellip;Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? How do you know she is a witch?</p>
<ul>
<li>Be quiet!</li>
<li>Bring her forward!</li>
<li>Oh, ow!</li>
<li>Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I&#8217;m being repressed!</li>
</ul>
<h3>We want a shrubbery!!</h3>
<p>But you are dressed as one&hellip; And this isn&#8217;t my nose. This is a false one. It&#8217;s only a model. Now, look here, my good man. I dunno. Must be a king. A newt?</p>
<h4>First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin</h4>
<p>Why? Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! How do you know she is a witch? He hasn&#8217;t got shit all over him. Shut up! Will you shut up?! Well, how&#8217;d you become king, then?</p>
<ol>
<li>I dunno. Must be a king.</li>
<li>Bring her forward!</li>
</ol>
<h5>Help, help, I&#8217;m being repressed!</h5>
<p>Shut up! Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! Bring her forward! You can&#8217;t expect to wield supreme power just &#8217;cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!</p>
<h6>What&hellip; is your quest?</h6>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time! What do you mean? Burn her! Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut&#8217;s tropical! What a strange person. No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she&#8217;s got a wart.</p>
