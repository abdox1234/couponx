										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s only a model. No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she&#8217;s got a wart. He hasn&#8217;t got shit all over him. Well, Mercia&#8217;s a temperate zone! The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.</p>
<h2>What… is your quest?</h2>
<p>The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! Look, my liege! No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she&#8217;s got a wart. And this isn&#8217;t my nose. This is a false one. I don&#8217;t want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</p>
<ul>
<li>The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!</li>
<li>Shut up! Will you shut up?!</li>
<li>Well, Mercia&#8217;s a temperate zone!</li>
</ul>
<h3>First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin</h3>
<p>Shut up! Will you shut up?! Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Shut up! Will you shut up?! Well, I didn&#8217;t vote for you. It&#8217;s only a model. I have to push the pram a lot.</p>
<h4>Blue. No, yel…</h4>
<p>Where&#8217;d you get the coconuts? And this isn&#8217;t my nose. This is a false one. What a strange person. Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. You don&#8217;t vote for kings.</p>
<ol>
<li>Who&#8217;s that then?</li>
<li>And this isn&#8217;t my nose. This is a false one.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</li>
<li>Be quiet!</li>
<li>We shall say &#8216;Ni&#8217; again to you, if you do not appease us.</li>
</ol>
<h5>First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin</h5>
<p>Well, I didn&#8217;t vote for you. Well, Mercia&#8217;s a temperate zone! Who&#8217;s that then? I&#8217;m not a witch. I don&#8217;t want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</p>
<h6>Help, help, I&#8217;m being repressed!</h6>
<p>The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king. Well, she turned me into a newt. A newt? No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she&#8217;s got a wart. On second thoughts, let&#8217;s not go there. It is a silly place.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. Kids, kids. I&#8217;m not going to die. That only happens to bad people. Kids, kids. I&#8217;m not going to die. That only happens to bad people. Slow down, Bart! My legs don&#8217;t know how to be as long as yours.<br />
</p>
<h2>The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show</h2>
<p>D&#8217;oh. What&#8217;s the point of going out? We&#8217;re just going to wind up back here anyway. When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power…like God must feel when he&#8217;s holding a gun. Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three &#8220;Highlander&#8221; movies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you&#8217;d step over your own mother just to get one! But you can&#8217;t stop at one. You wanna drink another woman!</li>
<li>When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power…like God must feel when he&#8217;s holding a gun.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Natural Born Kissers</h3>
<p>They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day. Save me, Jeebus. I didn&#8217;t get rich by signing checks.</p>
<h4>The Last Temptation of Homer</h4>
<p>I can&#8217;t go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. What good is money if it can&#8217;t inspire terror in your fellow man? Jesus must be spinning in his grave! Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I&#8217;m kidding, I&#8217;m kidding. I work, I work. And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold.</p>
<ol>
<li>Jesus must be spinning in his grave!</li>
<li>We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.</li>
<li>I was saying &#8220;Boo-urns.&#8221;</li>
<li>I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Marge vs. Monorail</h5>
<p>Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs. Human contact: the final frontier. Oh, so they have Internet on computers now!</p>
<h6>Homer the Great</h6>
<p>How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive? I don&#8217;t like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there&#8217;s too many fat children. I&#8217;ve done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! Homer no function beer well without. Me fail English? That&#8217;s unpossible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keep your mind limber. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. This man is a knight in shining armor. Keep your mind limber. You all right, Dexter?</p>
<h2>Born Free</h2>
<p>Watching ice melt. This is fun. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I&#8217;m real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. He taught me a code. To survive.</p>
<ul>
<li>I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me.</li>
<li>Finding a needle in a haystack isn&#8217;t hard when every straw is computerized.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Take It!</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m going to tell you something that I&#8217;ve never told anyone before. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. Like a sloth. I can do that. Cops, another community I&#8217;m not part of. I&#8217;m really more an apartment person.</p>
<h4>Father Knows Best</h4>
<p>You all right, Dexter? You all right, Dexter? He taught me a code. To survive. I&#8217;m really more an apartment person.</p>
<ol>
<li>Cops, another community I&#8217;m not part of.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m doing mental jumping jacks.</li>
<li>I think he&#8217;s got a crush on you, Dex!</li>
<li>I&#8217;m really more an apartment person.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Popping Cherry</h5>
<p>I think he&#8217;s got a crush on you, Dex! Cops, another community I&#8217;m not part of. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. He taught me a code. To survive. I think he&#8217;s got a crush on you, Dex! Watching ice melt. This is fun.</p>
<h6>An Inconvenient Lie</h6>
<p>I&#8217;m generally confused most of the time. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. I&#8217;m really more an apartment person. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. &hellip;And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night. That&#8217;s why I love elementary school, Edna. The children believe anything you tell them.</p>
<h2>Natural Born Kissers</h2>
<p>A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow&hellip;and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?* Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It&#8217;s what separates us from the animals&hellip;except the weasel. Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There&#8217;s a *New* Mexico?</p>
<ul>
<li>The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity&hellip;</li>
<li>Duffman can&#8217;t breathe! OH NO!</li>
</ul>

<p>Uh, no, they&#8217;re saying &#8220;Boo-urns, Boo-urns.&#8221; I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. Duffman can&#8217;t breathe! OH NO! Inflammable means flammable? What a country.</p>
<h4>Selma&#8217;s Choice</h4>
<p>&#8220;Thank the Lord&#8221;? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don&#8217;t have a place within an organized religion. I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. I hope this has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn. Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that&#8217;s even remotely true!</p>
<ol>
<li>I didn&#8217;t get rich by signing checks.</li>
<li>Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I&#8217;m kidding, I&#8217;m kidding. I work, I work.</li>
<li>Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Rosebud</h5>
<p>Jesus must be spinning in his grave! Hi. I&#8217;m Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as &#8220;Smoke Yourself Thin&#8221; and &#8220;Get Some Confidence, Stupid!&#8221; Last night&#8217;s &#8220;Itchy and Scratchy Show&#8221; was, without a doubt, the worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world. Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me! We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.</p>
<h6>Cape Feare</h6>
<p>Old people don&#8217;t need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use. Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone. Hi. I&#8217;m Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as &#8220;Smoke Yourself Thin&#8221; and &#8220;Get Some Confidence, Stupid!&#8221; Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it. Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. This is the greatest case of false advertising I&#8217;ve seen since I sued the movie &#8220;The Never Ending Story.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m normally not a praying man, but if you&#8217;re up there, please save me, Superman. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It&#8217;s what separates us from the animals&hellip;except the weasel. I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. When will I learn?

Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try.</p>
<h2>Radioactive Man</h2>
<p>Well, he&#8217;s kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace &#8220;accidentally&#8221; with &#8220;repeatedly&#8221; and replace &#8220;dog&#8221; with &#8220;son.&#8221; What&#8217;s the point of going out? We&#8217;re just going to wind up back here anyway. You don&#8217;t win friends with salad. I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. Bart, with $10,000 we&#8217;d be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like&hellip;love!</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix.</li>
<li>Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There&#8217;s a *New* Mexico?</li>
<li>Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rosebud</h3>
<p>Ahoy hoy? I&#8217;ll keep it short and sweet &mdash; Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. Bart, with $10,000 we&#8217;d be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like&hellip;love!</p>
<h4>Cape Feare</h4>
<p>Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix. Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you&#8217;re experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box&hellip; Uh, no, they&#8217;re saying &#8220;Boo-urns, Boo-urns.&#8221; Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark. &#8220;Thank the Lord&#8221;? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don&#8217;t have a place within an organized religion. I didn&#8217;t get rich by signing checks.</p>

<li>This is the greatest case of false advertising I&#8217;ve seen since I sued the movie &#8220;The Never Ending Story.&#8221;</li>
<li>When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power&hellip;like God must feel when he&#8217;s holding a gun.</li>
</ol>
<h5>The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show</h5>
<p>I hope I didn&#8217;t brain my damage. Jesus must be spinning in his grave! Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you&#8217;re experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box&hellip;</p>
<h6>Duffless</h6>
<p>I prefer a vehicle that doesn&#8217;t hurt Mother Earth. It&#8217;s a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction. I was saying &#8220;Boo-urns.&#8221; Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?*</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. Finding a needle in a haystack isn&#8217;t hard when every straw is computerized. I&#8217;m partial to air conditioning. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. Makes me a … scientist.</p>
<h2>Finding Freebo</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m not the monster he wants me to be. So I&#8217;m neither man nor beast. I&#8217;m something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I&#8217;m Dexter. Boo. This man is a knight in shining armor. You all right, Dexter?</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell him time is of the essence.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m really more an apartment person.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Road Kill</h3>
<p>I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. Finding a needle in a haystack isn&#8217;t hard when every straw is computerized. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me.</p>
<h4>An Inconvenient Lie</h4>
<p>Tell him time is of the essence. Cops, another community I&#8217;m not part of. Watching ice melt. This is fun. Watching ice melt. This is fun.</p>
<ol>
<li>This man is a knight in shining armor.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m doing mental jumping jacks.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Do You Take Morgan?</h5>
<p>You all right, Dexter? God created pudding, and then he rested. I&#8217;ve lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. Under normal circumstances, I&#8217;d take that as a compliment. Makes me a … scientist.</p>
<h6>Dex, Lies, and Videotape</h6>
<p>You all right, Dexter? Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. I have a dark side, too. I have a dark side, too.</p>
