										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. Kids, kids. I&#8217;m not going to die. That only happens to bad people. Kids, kids. I&#8217;m not going to die. That only happens to bad people. Slow down, Bart! My legs don&#8217;t know how to be as long as yours.<br />
</p>
<h2>The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show</h2>
<p>D&#8217;oh. What&#8217;s the point of going out? We&#8217;re just going to wind up back here anyway. When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power…like God must feel when he&#8217;s holding a gun. Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three &#8220;Highlander&#8221; movies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you&#8217;d step over your own mother just to get one! But you can&#8217;t stop at one. You wanna drink another woman!</li>
<li>When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power…like God must feel when he&#8217;s holding a gun.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Natural Born Kissers</h3>
<p>They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day. Save me, Jeebus. I didn&#8217;t get rich by signing checks.</p>
<h4>The Last Temptation of Homer</h4>
<p>I can&#8217;t go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. What good is money if it can&#8217;t inspire terror in your fellow man? Jesus must be spinning in his grave! Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I&#8217;m kidding, I&#8217;m kidding. I work, I work. And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold.</p>
<ol>
<li>Jesus must be spinning in his grave!</li>
<li>We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.</li>
<li>I was saying &#8220;Boo-urns.&#8221;</li>
<li>I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Marge vs. Monorail</h5>
<p>Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs. Human contact: the final frontier. Oh, so they have Internet on computers now!</p>
<h6>Homer the Great</h6>
<p>How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive? I don&#8217;t like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there&#8217;s too many fat children. I&#8217;ve done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! Homer no function beer well without. Me fail English? That&#8217;s unpossible.</p>

<h2>The Force Unleashed</h2>
<p>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. What good is a reward if you ain&#8217;t around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain&#8217;t my idea of courage. It&#8217;s more like…suicide. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I call it luck. Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. Partially, but it also obeys your commands.</p>
<ul>
<li>I can&#8217;t get involved! I&#8217;ve got work to do! It&#8217;s not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it right now. It&#8217;s such a long way from here.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t believe in the Force, do you?</li>
<li>Ye-ha!</li>
<li>You mean it controls your actions?</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Sith Lords</h3>
<p>What?! Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. What!?</p>
<h4>A New Hope</h4>
<p>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Red Five standing by. Alderaan? I&#8217;m not going to Alderaan. I&#8217;ve got to go home. It&#8217;s late, I&#8217;m in for it as it is. Ye-ha! I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I&#8217;m getting too old for this sort of thing.</p>
<ol>
<li>Look, I ain&#8217;t in this for your revolution, and I&#8217;m not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I&#8217;m in it for the money.</li>
<li>Your eyes can deceive you. Don&#8217;t trust them.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</li>
</ol>
<h5>The Empire Strikes Back</h5>
<p>You mean it controls your actions? You don&#8217;t believe in the Force, do you? The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>
<h6>The Sith Lords</h6>
<p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I&#8217;m getting too old for this sort of thing. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn&#8217;t I break his legs? Tell them I hate them. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn&#8217;t rock.</p>
<h2>The Honking</h2>
<p>Hey, guess what you&#8217;re accessories to. I love this planet! I&#8217;ve got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. Actually, that&#8217;s still true. Good man. Nixon&#8217;s pro-war and pro-family. Meh. Yeah, lots of people did.</p>
<ul>
<li>Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!</li>
<li>Bender, this is Fry&#8217;s decision… and he made it wrong. So it&#8217;s time for us to interfere in his life.</li>
<li>WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!</li>
<li>Hello Morbo, how&#8217;s the family?</li>
</ul>
<h3>A Big Piece of Garbage</h3>
<p>Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Man, I&#8217;m sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Well I&#8217;da done better, but it&#8217;s plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.</p>
<h4>The Why of Fry</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m sure those windmills will keep them cool. I was all of history&#8217;s great robot actors &#8211; Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! I saw you with those two &#8220;ladies of the evening&#8221; at Elzars. Explain that. I don&#8217;t &#8216;need&#8217; to drink. I can quit anytime I want!</p>
<ol>
<li>THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</li>
<li>I can explain. It&#8217;s very valuable.</li>
<li>Eeeee! Now say &#8220;nuclear wessels&#8221;!</li>
<li>Oh God, what have I done?</li>
</ol>
<h5>Parasites Lost</h5>
<p>You wouldn&#8217;t. Ask anyway! You wouldn&#8217;t. Ask anyway! I suppose I could part with &#8216;one&#8217; and still be feared…</p>
<h6>Anthology of Interest II</h6>
<p>With gusto. Our love isn&#8217;t any different from yours, except it&#8217;s hotter, because I&#8217;m involved. Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I&#8217;m going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What?! The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. I&#8217;m trying not to, kid.</p>
<h2>Jedi Academy</h2>
<p>Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. What!? As you wish. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you&#8217;re going.</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan&#8211;</li>
<li>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m trying not to, kid.</li>
<li>He is here.</li>
<li>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Empire Strikes Back</h3>
<p>As you wish. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. He is here.</p>
<h4>Jedi Academy</h4>
<p>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Don&#8217;t underestimate the Force. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There&#8217;s nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. What good is a reward if you ain&#8217;t around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain&#8217;t my idea of courage. It&#8217;s more like…suicide.</p>
<ol>
<li>Dantooine. They&#8217;re on Dantooine.</li>
<li>What good is a reward if you ain&#8217;t around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain&#8217;t my idea of courage. It&#8217;s more like…suicide.</li>
<li>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</li>
</ol>
<h5>The Phantom Menace</h5>
<p>I can&#8217;t get involved! I&#8217;ve got work to do! It&#8217;s not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it right now. It&#8217;s such a long way from here. Don&#8217;t underestimate the Force. Don&#8217;t underestimate the Force.</p>
<h6>Attack of the Clones</h6>
<p>Still, she&#8217;s got a lot of spirit. I don&#8217;t know, what do you think? Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. As you wish. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What&#8217;s Spanish for &#8220;I know you speak English?&#8221; First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn&#8217;t date magicians. There&#8217;s only one man I&#8217;ve ever called a coward, and that&#8217;s Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I&#8217;m calling you is a television actor. Michael! Marry me. I don&#8217;t criticize you! And if you&#8217;re worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense.</p>
<h2>Afternoon delight</h2>
<p>Steve Holt! Across from where? Really? Did nothing cancel? It&#8217;s a hug, Michael. I&#8217;m hugging you. I&#8217;m a monster. That&#8217;s why you always leave a note!</p>
<ul>
<li>That&#8217;s what it said on &#8216;Ask Jeeves.&#8217;</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t understand the question, and I won&#8217;t respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ready, Aim, Marry Me</h3>
<p>Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn&#8217;t like his trailer. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. Marry me. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough.</p>
<h4>Pier Pressure</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve opened a door here that I regret. We just call it a sausage. I care deeply for nature. Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you&#8217;ll have more fun. What&#8217;s Spanish for &#8220;I know you speak English?&#8221;</p>
<ol>
<li>Marry me.</li>
<li>Really? Did nothing cancel?</li>
<li>Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you&#8217;ll have more fun.</li>
<li>Across from where?</li>
<li>We just call it a sausage.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Pier Pressure</h5>
<p>Whoa, this guy&#8217;s straight? There&#8217;s so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. He&#8217;ll want to use your yacht, and I don&#8217;t want this thing smelling like fish. Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you&#8217;ll have more fun.</p>
<h6>Good Grief!</h6>
<p>Guy&#8217;s a pro. I don&#8217;t understand the question, and I won&#8217;t respond to it. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. I don&#8217;t understand the question, and I won&#8217;t respond to it. There&#8217;s only one man I&#8217;ve ever called a coward, and that&#8217;s Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I&#8217;m calling you is a television actor. Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn&#8217;t like his trailer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. He taught me a code. To survive. You&#8217;re a killer. I catch killers. Finding a needle in a haystack isn&#8217;t hard when every straw is computerized. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.</p>
<h2>Road Kill</h2>
<p>God created pudding, and then he rested. You all right, Dexter? I think he&#8217;s got a crush on you, Dex! I&#8217;m going to tell you something that I&#8217;ve never told anyone before.</p>
<ul>
<li>This man is a knight in shining armor.</li>
<li>This man is a knight in shining armor.</li>

<h3>The Lion Sleeps Tonight</h3>
<p>Cops, another community I&#8217;m not part of. This man is a knight in shining armor. This man is a knight in shining armor.</p>
<h4>First Blood</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m really more an apartment person. This man is a knight in shining armor. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. You all right, Dexter? I&#8217;m real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. I am not a killer.</p>
<ol>
<li>God created pudding, and then he rested.</li>

<li>You all right, Dexter?</li>

<h5>Teenage Wasteland</h5>
<p>I&#8217;m generally confused most of the time. Like a sloth. I can do that. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. Finding a needle in a haystack isn&#8217;t hard when every straw is computerized.</p>
<h6>The British Invasion</h6>
<p>Finding a needle in a haystack isn&#8217;t hard when every straw is computerized. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. Under normal circumstances, I&#8217;d take that as a compliment. You all right, Dexter?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>But with the blast shield down, I can&#8217;t even see! How am I supposed to fight? Don&#8217;t be too proud of this technological terror you&#8217;ve constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There&#8217;s nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
<h2>The Rebel Force</h2>
<p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I&#8217;m getting too old for this sort of thing. I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan&#8211; I want to come with you to Alderaan. There&#8217;s nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Ye-ha! The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</p>
<ul>
<li>I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</li>
<li>Your eyes can deceive you. Don&#8217;t trust them.</li>
<li>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Return of the Jedi</h3>
<p>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. Red Five standing by. Ye-ha! I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</p>
<h4>Imperial Star Destroyer</h4>
<p>I can&#8217;t get involved! I&#8217;ve got work to do! It&#8217;s not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it right now. It&#8217;s such a long way from here. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. You don&#8217;t believe in the Force, do you?</p>
<ol>
<li>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I&#8217;m getting too old for this sort of thing.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</li>
<li>Look, I ain&#8217;t in this for your revolution, and I&#8217;m not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I&#8217;m in it for the money.</li>
</ol>
<h5>The Phantom Menace</h5>
<p>Don&#8217;t be too proud of this technological terror you&#8217;ve constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. What good is a reward if you ain&#8217;t around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain&#8217;t my idea of courage. It&#8217;s more like&hellip;suicide. I call it luck.</p>
<h6>Rebel Mission to Ord Mantell</h6>
<p>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can&#8217;t possibly&hellip; The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan&#8211; I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan&#8211;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m normally not a praying man, but if you&#8217;re up there, please save me, Superman. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It&#8217;s what separates us from the animals&hellip;except the weasel. I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. When will I learn? The answers to life&#8217;s problems aren&#8217;t at the bottom of a bottle, they&#8217;re on TV! Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try.</p>
<h2>Radioactive Man</h2>
<p>Well, he&#8217;s kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace &#8220;accidentally&#8221; with &#8220;repeatedly&#8221; and replace &#8220;dog&#8221; with &#8220;son.&#8221; What&#8217;s the point of going out? We&#8217;re just going to wind up back here anyway. You don&#8217;t win friends with salad. I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. Bart, with $10,000 we&#8217;d be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like&hellip;love!</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix.</li>
<li>Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There&#8217;s a *New* Mexico?</li>
<li>Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rosebud</h3>
<p>Ahoy hoy? I&#8217;ll keep it short and sweet &mdash; Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. Bart, with $10,000 we&#8217;d be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like&hellip;love!</p>
<h4>Cape Feare</h4>
<p>Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix. Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you&#8217;re experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box&hellip; Uh, no, they&#8217;re saying &#8220;Boo-urns, Boo-urns.&#8221; Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark. &#8220;Thank the Lord&#8221;? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don&#8217;t have a place within an organized religion. I didn&#8217;t get rich by signing checks.</p>
<ol>
<li>I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world.</li>
<li>This is the greatest case of false advertising I&#8217;ve seen since I sued the movie &#8220;The Never Ending Story.&#8221;</li>
<li>When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power&hellip;like God must feel when he&#8217;s holding a gun.</li>
</ol>
<h5>The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show</h5>
<p>I hope I didn&#8217;t brain my damage. Jesus must be spinning in his grave! Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you&#8217;re experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box&hellip;</p>
<h6>Duffless</h6>
<p>I prefer a vehicle that doesn&#8217;t hurt Mother Earth. It&#8217;s a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction. I was saying &#8220;Boo-urns.&#8221; Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?*</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fry! Stay back! He&#8217;s too powerful! I&#8217;ve been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? I love you, buddy!</p>
<h2>The Deep South</h2>
<p>Good man. Nixon&#8217;s pro-war and pro-family. Say it in Russian! You lived before you met me?! Ooh, name it after me! Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Why would a robot need to drink?</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There&#8217;s only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!</li>
<li>You, a bobsleder!? That I&#8217;d like to see!</li>
<li>Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.</li>
</ul>
<h3>I Second That Emotion</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? It must be wonderful. You&#8217;re going to do his laundry? In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan!</p>
<h4>Put Your Head on my Shoulder</h4>
<p>You know, I was God once. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.</p>
<ol>
<li>THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</li>
<li>Calculon is gonna kill us and it&#8217;s all everybody else&#8217;s fault!</li>
<li>Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.</li>
<li>I love you, buddy!</li>
</ol>
<h5>Anthology of Interest I</h5>
<p>Bender, hurry! This fuel&#8217;s expensive! Also, we&#8217;re dying! Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Stop it, stop it. It&#8217;s fine. I will &#8216;destroy&#8217; you!</p>
<h6>Anthology of Interest I</h6>
<p>Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. I never loved you. Take me to your leader! Hey, whatcha watching?</p>
