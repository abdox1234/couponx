The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s only a model. No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she&#8217;s got a wart. He hasn&#8217;t got shit all over him. Well, Mercia&#8217;s a temperate zone! The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.</p>
<h2>What… is your quest?</h2>
<p>The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! Look, my liege! No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she&#8217;s got a wart. And this isn&#8217;t my nose. This is a false one. I don&#8217;t want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</p>
<ul>
<li>The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!</li>
<li>Shut up! Will you shut up?!</li>
<li>Well, Mercia&#8217;s a temperate zone!</li>
</ul>
<h3>First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin</h3>
<p>Shut up! Will you shut up?! Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Shut up! Will you shut up?! Well, I didn&#8217;t vote for you. It&#8217;s only a model. I have to push the pram a lot.</p>
<h4>Blue. No, yel…</h4>
<p>Where&#8217;d you get the coconuts? And this isn&#8217;t my nose. This is a false one. What a strange person. Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. You don&#8217;t vote for kings.</p>
<ol>
<li>Who&#8217;s that then?</li>
<li>And this isn&#8217;t my nose. This is a false one.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</li>
<li>Be quiet!</li>
<li>We shall say &#8216;Ni&#8217; again to you, if you do not appease us.</li>
</ol>
<h5>First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin</h5>
<p>Well, I didn&#8217;t vote for you. Well, Mercia&#8217;s a temperate zone! Who&#8217;s that then? I&#8217;m not a witch. I don&#8217;t want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</p>
<h6>Help, help, I&#8217;m being repressed!</h6>
<p>The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king. Well, she turned me into a newt. A newt? No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she&#8217;s got a wart. On second thoughts, let&#8217;s not go there. It is a silly place.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What&#8217;s Spanish for &#8220;I know you speak English?&#8221; First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn&#8217;t date magicians. There&#8217;s only one man I&#8217;ve ever called a coward, and that&#8217;s Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I&#8217;m calling you is a television actor. Michael! Marry me. I don&#8217;t criticize you! And if you&#8217;re worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense.</p>
<h2>Afternoon delight</h2>
<p>Steve Holt! Across from where? Really? Did nothing cancel? It&#8217;s a hug, Michael. I&#8217;m hugging you. I&#8217;m a monster. That&#8217;s why you always leave a note!</p>
<ul>
<li>That&#8217;s what it said on &#8216;Ask Jeeves.&#8217;</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t understand the question, and I won&#8217;t respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ready, Aim, Marry Me</h3>
<p>Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn&#8217;t like his trailer. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. Marry me. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough.</p>
<h4>Pier Pressure</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve opened a door here that I regret. We just call it a sausage. I care deeply for nature. Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you&#8217;ll have more fun. What&#8217;s Spanish for &#8220;I know you speak English?&#8221;</p>
<ol>
<li>Marry me.</li>
<li>Really? Did nothing cancel?</li>
<li>Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you&#8217;ll have more fun.</li>
<li>Across from where?</li>
<li>We just call it a sausage.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Pier Pressure</h5>
<p>Whoa, this guy&#8217;s straight? There&#8217;s so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. He&#8217;ll want to use your yacht, and I don&#8217;t want this thing smelling like fish. Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you&#8217;ll have more fun.</p>
<h6>Good Grief!</h6>
<p>Guy&#8217;s a pro. I don&#8217;t understand the question, and I won&#8217;t respond to it. Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. I don&#8217;t understand the question, and I won&#8217;t respond to it. There&#8217;s only one man I&#8217;ve ever called a coward, and that&#8217;s Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I&#8217;m calling you is a television actor. Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn&#8217;t like his trailer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. He taught me a code. To survive. You&#8217;re a killer. I catch killers.

<h2>Road Kill</h2>
<p>God created pudding, and then he rested. You all right, Dexter? I think he&#8217;s got a crush on you, Dex! I&#8217;m going to tell you something that I&#8217;ve never told anyone before.</p>

<h2>Am I right?</h2>

<h3>We want a shrubbery!!</h3>
<p>But you are dressed as one&hellip; And this isn&#8217;t my nose. This is a false one. It&#8217;s only a model. Now, look here, my good man. I dunno. Must be a king. A newt?</p>
<h4>First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin</h4>
<p>Why? Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! How do you know she is a witch? He hasn&#8217;t got shit all over him. Shut up! Will you shut up?! Well, how&#8217;d you become king, then?</p>

<h6>What&hellip; is your quest?</h6>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time! What do you mean? Burn her! Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut&#8217;s tropical! What a strange person. No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit.
