										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s only a model. No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she&#8217;s got a wart. He hasn&#8217;t got shit all over him. Well, Mercia&#8217;s a temperate zone! The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.</p>
<h2>What… is your quest?</h2>
<p>The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! Look, my liege! No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she&#8217;s got a wart. And this isn&#8217;t my nose. This is a false one. I don&#8217;t want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</p>
<ul>
<li>The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!</li>
<li>Shut up! Will you shut up?!</li>
<li>Well, Mercia&#8217;s a temperate zone!</li>
</ul>
<h3>First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin</h3>
<p>Shut up! Will you shut up?! Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Shut up! Will you shut up?! Well, I didn&#8217;t vote for you. It&#8217;s only a model. I have to push the pram a lot.</p>
<h4>Blue. No, yel…</h4>
<p>Where&#8217;d you get the coconuts? And this isn&#8217;t my nose. This is a false one. What a strange person. Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. You don&#8217;t vote for kings.</p>
<ol>
<li>Who&#8217;s that then?</li>
<li>And this isn&#8217;t my nose. This is a false one.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</li>
<li>Be quiet!</li>
<li>We shall say &#8216;Ni&#8217; again to you, if you do not appease us.</li>
</ol>
<h5>First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin</h5>
<p>Well, I didn&#8217;t vote for you. Well, Mercia&#8217;s a temperate zone! Who&#8217;s that then? I&#8217;m not a witch. I don&#8217;t want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</p>
<h6>Help, help, I&#8217;m being repressed!</h6>
<p>The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king. Well, she turned me into a newt. A newt? No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she&#8217;s got a wart. On second thoughts, let&#8217;s not go there. It is a silly place.</p>

<h2>The Force Unleashed</h2>
<p>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. What good is a reward if you ain&#8217;t around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain&#8217;t my idea of courage. It&#8217;s more like…suicide. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I call it luck. Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. Partially, but it also obeys your commands.</p>
<ul>
<li>I can&#8217;t get involved! I&#8217;ve got work to do! It&#8217;s not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it right now. It&#8217;s such a long way from here.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t believe in the Force, do you?</li>
<li>Ye-ha!</li>
<li>You mean it controls your actions?</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Sith Lords</h3>
<p>What?! Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. What!?</p>
<h4>A New Hope</h4>
<p>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Red Five standing by. Alderaan? I&#8217;m not going to Alderaan. I&#8217;ve got to go home. It&#8217;s late, I&#8217;m in for it as it is. Ye-ha! I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I&#8217;m getting too old for this sort of thing.</p>
<ol>
<li>Look, I ain&#8217;t in this for your revolution, and I&#8217;m not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I&#8217;m in it for the money.</li>
<li>Your eyes can deceive you. Don&#8217;t trust them.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</li>
</ol>
<h5>The Empire Strikes Back</h5>
<p>You mean it controls your actions? You don&#8217;t believe in the Force, do you? The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>
<h6>The Sith Lords</h6>
<p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I&#8217;m getting too old for this sort of thing. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Don&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OK, this has gotta stop. I&#8217;m going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Hey! I&#8217;m a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Ah, computer dating. It&#8217;s like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase &#8220;upside your head.&#8221; I love this planet! I&#8217;ve got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.</p>
<h2>The Cyber House Rules</h2>
<p>Ummm&hellip;to eBay? Hey, guess what you&#8217;re accessories to. Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.</p>
<ul>
<li>I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m Santa Claus!</li>
<li>Leela, Bender, we&#8217;re going grave robbing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Xmas Story</h3>
<p>With gusto. Ah, the &#8216;Breakfast Club&#8217; soundtrack! I can&#8217;t wait til I&#8217;m old enough to feel ways about stuff! Fetal stemcells, aren&#8217;t those controversial? Bender, this is Fry&#8217;s decision&hellip; and he made it wrong. So it&#8217;s time for us to interfere in his life. And remember, don&#8217;t do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don&#8217;t not do it!</p>
<h4>Attack of the Killer App</h4>
<p>But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!</p>
<ol>
<li>Fry, you can&#8217;t just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.</li>
<li>Meh.</li>
<li>If rubbin&#8217; frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don&#8217;t wanna be right.</li>
</ol>
<h5>In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela</h5>
<p>Ah, computer dating. It&#8217;s like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase &#8220;upside your head.&#8221; Ooh, name it after me! Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!</p>
<h6>Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences</h6>
<p>Bender, being God isn&#8217;t easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Hey, tell me something. You&#8217;ve got all this money. How come you always dress like you&#8217;re doing your laundry? Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! I never loved you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. Finding a needle in a haystack isn&#8217;t hard when every straw is computerized. I&#8217;m partial to air conditioning. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. Makes me a … scientist.</p>
<h2>Finding Freebo</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m not the monster he wants me to be. So I&#8217;m neither man nor beast. I&#8217;m something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I&#8217;m Dexter. Boo. This man is a knight in shining armor. You all right, Dexter?</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell him time is of the essence.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m really more an apartment person.</li>
