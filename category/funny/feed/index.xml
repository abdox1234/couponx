										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn&#8217;t I break his legs? Tell them I hate them. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn&#8217;t rock.</p>
<h2>The Honking</h2>
<p>Hey, guess what you&#8217;re accessories to. I love this planet! I&#8217;ve got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. Actually, that&#8217;s still true. Good man. Nixon&#8217;s pro-war and pro-family. Meh. Yeah, lots of people did.</p>
<ul>
<li>Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!</li>
<li>Bender, this is Fry&#8217;s decision… and he made it wrong. So it&#8217;s time for us to interfere in his life.</li>
<li>WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!</li>
<li>Hello Morbo, how&#8217;s the family?</li>
</ul>
<h3>A Big Piece of Garbage</h3>
<p>Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Man, I&#8217;m sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Well I&#8217;da done better, but it&#8217;s plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.</p>
<h4>The Why of Fry</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m sure those windmills will keep them cool. I was all of history&#8217;s great robot actors &#8211; Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! I saw you with those two &#8220;ladies of the evening&#8221; at Elzars. Explain that. I don&#8217;t &#8216;need&#8217; to drink. I can quit anytime I want!</p>
<ol>
<li>THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</li>
<li>I can explain. It&#8217;s very valuable.</li>
<li>Eeeee! Now say &#8220;nuclear wessels&#8221;!</li>
<li>Oh God, what have I done?</li>
</ol>
<h5>Parasites Lost</h5>
<p>You wouldn&#8217;t. Ask anyway! You wouldn&#8217;t. Ask anyway! I suppose I could part with &#8216;one&#8217; and still be feared…</p>
<h6>Anthology of Interest II</h6>
<p>With gusto. Our love isn&#8217;t any different from yours, except it&#8217;s hotter, because I&#8217;m involved. Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I&#8217;m going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keep your mind limber. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. This man is a knight in shining armor. Keep your mind limber. You all right, Dexter?</p>
<h2>Born Free</h2>
<p>Watching ice melt. This is fun. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I&#8217;m real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. He taught me a code. To survive.</p>
<ul>
<li>I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me.</li>
<li>Finding a needle in a haystack isn&#8217;t hard when every straw is computerized.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Take It!</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m going to tell you something that I&#8217;ve never told anyone before. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. Like a sloth. I can do that. Cops, another community I&#8217;m not part of. I&#8217;m really more an apartment person.</p>
<h4>Father Knows Best</h4>
<p>You all right, Dexter? You all right, Dexter? He taught me a code. To survive. I&#8217;m really more an apartment person.</p>
<ol>
<li>Cops, another community I&#8217;m not part of.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m doing mental jumping jacks.</li>
<li>I think he&#8217;s got a crush on you, Dex!</li>
<li>I&#8217;m really more an apartment person.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Popping Cherry</h5>
<p>I think he&#8217;s got a crush on you, Dex! Cops, another community I&#8217;m not part of. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. He taught me a code. To survive. I think he&#8217;s got a crush on you, Dex! Watching ice melt. This is fun.</p>
<h6>An Inconvenient Lie</h6>
<p>I&#8217;m generally confused most of the time. Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. I&#8217;m really more an apartment person. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. &hellip;And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night. That&#8217;s why I love elementary school, Edna. The children believe anything you tell them.</p>
<h2>Natural Born Kissers</h2>
<p>A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow&hellip;and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?* Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It&#8217;s what separates us from the animals&hellip;except the weasel. Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There&#8217;s a *New* Mexico?</p>
<ul>
<li>The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity&hellip;</li>
<li>Duffman can&#8217;t breathe! OH NO!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Life on the Fast Lane</h3>
<p>Uh, no, they&#8217;re saying &#8220;Boo-urns, Boo-urns.&#8221; I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. Duffman can&#8217;t breathe! OH NO! Inflammable means flammable? What a country.</p>
<h4>Selma&#8217;s Choice</h4>
<p>&#8220;Thank the Lord&#8221;? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don&#8217;t have a place within an organized religion. I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. I hope this has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn. Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that&#8217;s even remotely true!</p>
<ol>
<li>I didn&#8217;t get rich by signing checks.</li>
<li>Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I&#8217;m kidding, I&#8217;m kidding. I work, I work.</li>
<li>Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Rosebud</h5>
<p>Jesus must be spinning in his grave! Hi. I&#8217;m Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as &#8220;Smoke Yourself Thin&#8221; and &#8220;Get Some Confidence, Stupid!&#8221; Last night&#8217;s &#8220;Itchy and Scratchy Show&#8221; was, without a doubt, the worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world. Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me! We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.</p>
<h6>Cape Feare</h6>
<p>Old people don&#8217;t need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use. Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone. Hi. I&#8217;m Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as &#8220;Smoke Yourself Thin&#8221; and &#8220;Get Some Confidence, Stupid!&#8221; Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it. Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen. This is the greatest case of false advertising I&#8217;ve seen since I sued the movie &#8220;The Never Ending Story.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, how&#8217;d you become king, then? Well, Mercia&#8217;s a temperate zone! I dunno. Must be a king. The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OK, this has gotta stop. I&#8217;m going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Hey! I&#8217;m a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Ah, computer dating. It&#8217;s like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase &#8220;upside your head.&#8221; I love this planet! I&#8217;ve got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.</p>
<h2>The Cyber House Rules</h2>
<p>Ummm&hellip;to eBay? Hey, guess what you&#8217;re accessories to. Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.</p>
<ul>
<li>I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m Santa Claus!</li>
<li>Leela, Bender, we&#8217;re going grave robbing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Xmas Story</h3>
<p>With gusto. Ah, the &#8216;Breakfast Club&#8217; soundtrack! I can&#8217;t wait til I&#8217;m old enough to feel ways about stuff! Fetal stemcells, aren&#8217;t those controversial? Bender, this is Fry&#8217;s decision&hellip; and he made it wrong. So it&#8217;s time for us to interfere in his life. And remember, don&#8217;t do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don&#8217;t not do it!</p>
<h4>Attack of the Killer App</h4>
<p>But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!</p>
<ol>
<li>Fry, you can&#8217;t just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.</li>
<li>Meh.</li>
<li>If rubbin&#8217; frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don&#8217;t wanna be right.</li>
</ol>
<h5>In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela</h5>
<p>Ah, computer dating. It&#8217;s like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase &#8220;upside your head.&#8221; Ooh, name it after me! Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!</p>
<h6>Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences</h6>
<p>Bender, being God isn&#8217;t easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Hey, tell me something. You&#8217;ve got all this money. How come you always dress like you&#8217;re doing your laundry? Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! I never loved you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m normally not a praying man, but if you&#8217;re up there, please save me, Superman. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It&#8217;s what separates us from the animals&hellip;except the weasel. I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. When will I learn? The answers to life&#8217;s problems aren&#8217;t at the bottom of a bottle, they&#8217;re on TV! Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try.</p>
<h2>Radioactive Man</h2>
<p>Well, he&#8217;s kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace &#8220;accidentally&#8221; with &#8220;repeatedly&#8221; and replace &#8220;dog&#8221; with &#8220;son.&#8221; What&#8217;s the point of going out? We&#8217;re just going to wind up back here anyway. You don&#8217;t win friends with salad. I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world. Bart, with $10,000 we&#8217;d be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like&hellip;love!</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix.</li>
<li>Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There&#8217;s a *New* Mexico?</li>
<li>Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rosebud</h3>
<p>Ahoy hoy? I&#8217;ll keep it short and sweet &mdash; Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. Bart, with $10,000 we&#8217;d be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like&hellip;love!</p>
<h4>Cape Feare</h4>
<p>Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix. Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you&#8217;re experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box&hellip; Uh, no, they&#8217;re saying &#8220;Boo-urns, Boo-urns.&#8221; Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark. &#8220;Thank the Lord&#8221;? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don&#8217;t have a place within an organized religion. I didn&#8217;t get rich by signing checks.</p>
<ol>
<li>I&#8217;m a Spalding Gray in a Rick Dees world.</li>
<li>This is the greatest case of false advertising I&#8217;ve seen since I sued the movie &#8220;The Never Ending Story.&#8221;</li>
<li>When I held that gun in my hand, I felt a surge of power&hellip;like God must feel when he&#8217;s holding a gun.</li>
</ol>
<h5>The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show</h5>
<p>I hope I didn&#8217;t brain my damage. Jesus must be spinning in his grave! Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you&#8217;re experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box&hellip;</p>
<h6>Duffless</h6>
<p>I prefer a vehicle that doesn&#8217;t hurt Mother Earth. It&#8217;s a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction. I was saying &#8220;Boo-urns.&#8221; Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?*</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. Finding a needle in a haystack isn&#8217;t hard when every straw is computerized. I&#8217;m partial to air conditioning. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. Makes me a … scientist.</p>
<h2>Finding Freebo</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m not the monster he wants me to be. So I&#8217;m neither man nor beast. I&#8217;m something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I&#8217;m Dexter. Boo. This man is a knight in shining armor. You all right, Dexter?</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell him time is of the essence.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m really more an apartment person.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Road Kill</h3>
<p>I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me. Finding a needle in a haystack isn&#8217;t hard when every straw is computerized. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me.</p>
<h4>An Inconvenient Lie</h4>
<p>Tell him time is of the essence. Cops, another community I&#8217;m not part of. Watching ice melt. This is fun. Watching ice melt. This is fun.</p>
<ol>
<li>This man is a knight in shining armor.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m doing mental jumping jacks.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Do You Take Morgan?</h5>
<p>You all right, Dexter? God created pudding, and then he rested. I&#8217;ve lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. Under normal circumstances, I&#8217;d take that as a compliment. Makes me a … scientist.</p>
<h6>Dex, Lies, and Videotape</h6>
<p>You all right, Dexter? Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. I have a dark side, too. I have a dark side, too.</p>

Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! The Unicorn and the Wasp I&#8217;m the Doctor, I&#8217;m worse than everyone&#8217;s aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I&#8217;m introducing myself. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don&#8217;t lie to me! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! It&#8217;s a fez.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I&#8217;ve always known him: Jeff. You hit me with a cricket bat. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!</p>
<h2>The Unicorn and the Wasp</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m the Doctor, I&#8217;m worse than everyone&#8217;s aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I&#8217;m introducing myself. I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don&#8217;t lie to me!</p>
<ul>
<li>Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!</li>
<li>It&#8217;s a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Forest of the Dead</h3>
<p>The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don&#8217;t always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don&#8217;t necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. I hate yogurt. It&#8217;s just stuff with bits in. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won&#8217;t stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I&#8217;m the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm &#8211; and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn&#8217;t you?</p>
<h4>Midnight</h4>
<p>*Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I&#8217;m a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! You hit me with a cricket bat. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?</p>
<ol>
<li>They&#8217;re not aliens, they&#8217;re Earth…liens!</li>
<li>Annihilate? No. No violence. I won&#8217;t stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I&#8217;m the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm &#8211; and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn&#8217;t you?</li>
<li>You know when grown-ups tell you &#8216;everything&#8217;s going to be fine&#8217; and you think they&#8217;re probably lying to make you feel better?</li>
<li>It&#8217;s a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.</li>
</ol>
<h5>The Impossible Astronaut</h5>
<p>Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. I&#8217;m nobody&#8217;s taxi service; I&#8217;m not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. I&#8217;m nobody&#8217;s taxi service; I&#8217;m not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. No, I&#8217;ll fix it. I&#8217;m good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I&#8217;m the Doctor. Don&#8217;t call me the Rotmeister. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I&#8217;m a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!</p>
<h6>Journey&#8217;s End</h6>
<p>I&#8217;m the Doctor, I&#8217;m worse than everyone&#8217;s aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I&#8217;m introducing myself. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! I hate yogurt. It&#8217;s just stuff with bits in. You&#8217;ve swallowed a planet! Did I mention we have comfy chairs? They&#8217;re not aliens, they&#8217;re Earth…liens!</p>
